## Login Using Inet


</div>

### Description

This is just another way of doing a user system for your program... How it works is whenever u wana add a new user you edit users.txt on your web server and then your program has that user in it... You could probably put a function to sign up in your program, and make it so it uses the ftp server of your web host to edit the users.txt and add the username... I havnt figured out how to make it so every user has his/her own password, but if you know e-mail me, s_p_i_t_f_i_r_e_@hotmail.com.
